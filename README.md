# Dragon Fruit Disease Detection System Using CNN
# Overview

This project focuses on classifying Dragon fruit into different categories based on their health conditions, such as "Fresh Dragon Fruit and Diseased Dragon Fruit." The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately identify and classify fruits into these categories using image data.

# The project involves:

Data preprocessing and augmentation.
Training a deep learning model (e.g., CNN) for image classification.
Evaluating the model using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
Addressing class imbalance and improving model performance for minority classes.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of images of fruits categorized into the following classes:

Fresh Dragon Fruit

Rust Spot

Soft Rot Fruit

Stem Canker

The dataset is created by us.

# Project Structure

1. Data Preprocessing  
2. Training the Model
3. Evaluating the Model


## **Model Performance**
The model's performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score. Below are the results:

| Class               | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|---------------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Fresh Dragon Fruit  | 0.95      | 0.87   | 0.91     | 2000    |
| Rust Spot           | 0.51      | 0.95   | 0.66     | 642     |
| Soft Rot Fruit      | 0.99      | 0.91   | 0.95     | 4050    |
| Stem Canker         | 0.00      | 0.00   | 0.00     | 32      |

- **Accuracy**: 90%
- **Macro Avg F1-Score**: 0.63
- **Weighted Avg F1-Score**: 0.91
